# EDA — Global Coffee Production & Prices

## Overview

This repository presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of historical global coffee production, harvested area, and international coffee prices.  
The analysis emphasizes **descriptive statistics and data visualization** to characterize distributions, variability, asymmetry, and long-term patterns across major coffee-producing countries.

Rather than establishing causal relationships, the focus is on **understanding structural behaviors, trends, and stylized facts** present in agricultural and price data.
